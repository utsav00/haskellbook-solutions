# Heal the Sick

### Find mistakes and fix them

1. let area x = 3. 14 * (x * x)

> let area x = 3.14 * (x * x)
- Shouldn't be any space after '.' in 3.14

2. let double x = b * 2
- b is a free variable

3. ```Haskell
 x = 7  
y = 10  
f = x + y
```

- The error is because the second line does not start from the same column or to put it more simply, the indentation does not follow the suit of the earlier statements
